            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You're looking at the brand-new website for sabre/dav. Up until now sabre/dav
never had a proper website, and we've always just hosted from Google Code.</p>

<p>As Google slowly started to lose interested in code hosting, we migrated more
and more features to GitHub. The biggest thing left: the wiki. So what once
started as a place to host the new wiki, turned into a brand-new design, by
<a href="https://fruux.com/">our</a> very own Martin Kaniut, who's also responsible for the <a href="https://fruux.com/">fruux</a>
design.</p>

<p>We hope you like it, but since it's such a step up from Google Code, we're
confident you probably will ;). If you're running into any bugs, definitely
<a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre.io/issues">let us know</a>. Want to contribute to the wiki? The entire site is open source, so
<a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre.io/tree/master/source">take a look</a> at some of the existing pages and get cracking!</p>
