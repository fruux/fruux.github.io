            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/dav 2.0.3.</p>

<p>A number of problems were found in the revamped browser plugin, related to
generating links, and for a number of people none of the css and images
would load due to incorrect CSP rules.</p>

<p>In addition we found out that the <code>TooMuchMatches</code> exception never worked
due to a fatal error, so while fixing that, we also took the opportunity to
change the name of the exception to <code>TooManyMatches</code>. Don't laugh.</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/dav by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/dav

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/event 2.0.0. This releases adds a few features, and
also slightly alters the API.</p>

<h3>New stuff</h3>

<ol>
<li>Support for <a href="/event/promise/">promises</a>.</li>
<li>The event handler is now faster. This is especially noticable when making a
lot of subscriptions to a single event, and is likely unnoticable for most.</li>
<li>Added support for something called the 'continue callback' to to the
EventEmitter. This makes it possible to implement something similar to
javascript's <code>preventDefault</code>.</li>
<li>When calling removeAllListeners without an argument, all listeners for all
events are removed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Api breaks</h3>

<ol>
<li>We switched to PSR-4 for autoloading.</li>
<li>EventEmitter::listeners() no longer returns a manipulatable array of event
listeners by reference. It's not a simple list of callbacks, sorted by
their priority. The original concept was good on paper.</li>
<li>The argument on <code>removeAllListeners</code> is now optional.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upgrade sabre/event by making sure your composer.json references <code>~2.0.0</code>, and
then run:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/event
</code></pre>

            <link href="http://sabre.io/blog/2014/jcal-rfc"/>
            <updated>2014-06-02T20:55:42+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://sabre.io/blog/2014/jcal-rfc</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The IETF just made <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7265">jCal</a> available as <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7265">rfc7265</a></p>

<p>jCal is a format to encode <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545">iCalendar</a>, but instead of using the clumsy, and
old 'mimedir' format, it uses <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> to encode the data.</p>

<p>This is very similar to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7095">jCard</a>, which is the json-encoded version of
vCards.</p>

<p>We're big fans of this new format. It can already be parsed by <a href="/vobject/json/">vobject</a>
and if you're running sabre/dav 2.0, the server can already emit it from REPORT
and GET requests and accept it from PUT requests.</p>

<p>We recommend everyone in the industry to consider generating jCal where they
are generating iCalendar today. It's a lot easier to parse and generate, and
we hope that over time, jCal and jCard replace iCalendar and vCard as the
format of choice.</p>

            <updated>2014-05-22T17:13:48+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabredav-2-release</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/dav 2.0. The last major release (1.8) was in <a href="http://evertpot.com/sabredav-18-released-with-namespaces/">2012</a>,
so it's been a long time coming.</p>

<h2>New features</h2>

<h3>New browser</h3>

<p><a href="/img/posts/new-browser.png" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
    <img src="/img/posts/new-browser.png" alt="new browser!" class="zoomAbleImage" width="300px" style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px #000"/>
</a></p>

<p>The browser got a big overhaul. It hadn't changed much since when it was
introduced in 2009, so a visual refresh was long due.</p>

<p>The new browser plugin shows you a lot more information about webdav
properties as well, making it a more useful debugging tool.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>A lot of focus has gone into performance, specifically in relation to Cal- and
CardDAV. We've been running the bleeding edge sabredav, and we've seen several
major cpu drops as we've kept sabredav up to date.</p>

<p>We've optimized queries, and provided new shortcuts in the system that allowed
backends to do optimizations that were not possible before.</p>

<p>Lastly, we added WebDAV-Sync support.</p>

<h3>WebDAV-Sync</h3>

<p>Support for WebDAV-Sync (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6578">rfc6578</a>) has been added. WebDAV-Sync is used by
an increasing number of popular Cal- and CardDAV clients. It allows clients to
request a list of changes that happened in calendar and/or addressbooks. This
can greatly reduce memory, bandwidth and cpu usage on both client and server,
and is well worth it.</p>

<p>It's available as a plugin and the appropriate interfaces have been added to
add support for WebDAV-Sync to the collections where you want to support it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, both the default Cal- and CardDAV PDO backends have out of the
box support.</p>

<h3>New packages</h3>

<p>This is the first sabredav release that ships with <a href="/vobject">sabre/vobject</a> 3.0, and
is also the first release that has part of it's functionality split out into
two new packages: <a href="/event">sabre/event</a> and <a href="/http">sabre/http</a>.</p>

<h3>Calendar subscription syncing</h3>

<p>There's a proprietary protocol that allows calendar clients to sync
subscriptions with a server. Support for this has been added to the CalDAV
plugin, and is also available in the default PDO backend.</p>

<p>This protocol is at least supported by <a href="http://www.busymac.com/busycal/">BusyCal</a> and Apple's iOS and OS X
clients.</p>

<h3>jCal support</h3>

<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jcardcal-jcal-10">jCal</a> is an upcoming standard for representing iCalendar objects in json.
sabre/dav now live converts back and forward between iCalendar and jCal, and
can return jCal everywhere it returns iCalendar.</p>

<p>We highly recommend using jCal over iCalendar. It's a much better format,
easier to parse, and likely to use less memory and cpu while parsing.</p>

<h3>New property system</h3>

<p>A big part of DAV protocols is related to storing and retrieving properties
on resources such as files and calendars.</p>

<p>The property system got a complete overhaul for this release. This allowed
for a great reduction in property-related code and allows for a new feature:
<a href="/dav/properties">storage of arbitrary properties</a>.</p>

<h3>PHP 5.4</h3>

<p>The minimum php version of sabre/dav has been increased to PHP 5.4. This was
needed for a number of reasons, such as better closure support and traits.</p>

<h3>And...</h3>

<p>The list of changes is rather massive. Read up on them in the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/blob/master/ChangeLog.md">ChangeLog</a>
from <code>1.9.0alpha1</code> onwards.</p>

<p>Also, this includes all the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-vobject/blob/master/ChangeLog.md">changes from sabre/vobject</a> from 3.0.0 onwards,
<a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-http/blob/master/ChangeLog">changes from sabre/http</a> from 2.0.0 onwards and everything from
sabre/event.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>As always, the zip can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/releases/">github releases page</a>, but the
recommended installation method is using composer:</p>

<pre><code>composer install sabre/dav ~2.0.0
</code></pre>

<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<p>A lot of things have changed in this release. If you are running a standard
server, it's likely that you only have to run the database upgrade script,
but if you did any sort of customizations, chances are that you need to make
changes in your code to keep stuff running.</p>

<p><strong>Make a backup.</strong> and then head to the <a href="/dav/upgrade/1.8-to-2.0/">migration instructions</a> for 2.0.</p>

<p>Drop a line on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sabredav-discuss">mailing list</a> if you run into any issues at all.</p>

<h2>Support status</h2>

<p>As of right now version <strong>1.7</strong> is no longer supported. <strong>1.8</strong> will be
supported for an entire year, until May 2015.</p>

<h2>Thank you</h2>

<p>This was literally the largest release we've ever done, seeing the biggest
diff, most new features, most contributors and longest development time.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for hanging in there and all your contributions.</p>

<p>I want to specifically thank <a href="https://github.com/staabm">Markus Staab</a> for tirelessly reviewing every
incoming commit, and <a href="https://twitter.com/DominikTo">Dominik Tobschall</a> for all the moral support.</p>

<p>Evert.</p>
