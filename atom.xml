            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dealing with XML is annoying to many, and certainly us. We've tried many
different approaches to make working with XML less frustrating, and we've
finally landed on an approach that we're happy with.</p>

<p>We're launching sabre/xml to the public today. You can find a bit of an
overview on <a href="http://evertpot.com/an-xml-library-you-may-not-hate/">this blog</a>, or you can jump straight in the <a href="/xml/">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>This library is already integrated into the master branch of sabre/dav, which
will be released as 2.2 soon. We rewrote almost all our XML handling code,
and there was quite a bit! The next release has over 10.000 changed lines.</p>

<p>The next major version of sabre/vobject will also depend on it to support
reading and writing xCal and xCard.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/vobject 3.4.0. This release has a number of
improvements and bugfixes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Recurrence expansion and parsing is now a <em>lot</em> faster on big calendars.
Our test iCalendar file was about 5MB large with an unusual high amount
of recurrence rules. We got about a 1900% increase in speed. Most
real-world calendars will not be as large, but should still benefit from
this quite a bit.</li>
<li>We're now supporting parsing and validating <code>VAVAILABILITY</code> components,
which is a new iCalendar component that may become an internet standard,
but is currently still a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-calendar-availability">draft</a>. In the future we'll also add support
for this in the freebusy generator, which will make it useful for sabre/dav
users.</li>
<li>Updated to the latest timezone information.</li>
<li>Several other bugfixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

<p>If this didn't upgrade you to 3.4, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "~3.4"
</code></pre>

<p>Version 3.4.0 is 100% compatbile with vobject 3.3.*</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released version 1.0.0 of a new URI library. This library solves a
few common problems we've been having, or simply did not do well enough in
the past.</p>

<p>The library is super light-weight and just provides 5 functions. We hope
it's useful for other people aside from us, but we'll be adding this as a new
dependency to sabre/xml, sabre/http, sabre/dav and in the future sabre/vobject,
as they all do 'stuff' with URIs, and were not doing everything in the best
way possible.</p>
