<p>Further in-depth testing of the <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip</a> subsystem has revealed a <em>lot</em> of
small edge-cases that weren't properly covered.</p>

<p>In addition, we now correctly decode <code>ATTACH</code> properties in iCalendar objects
that are specified as a URI, and fixed a few validator rules.</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

<p>If this didn't upgrade you to 3.3.2, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "~3.3.2"
</code></pre>

<p>This releases has a number of improvements, namely:</p>

<ol>
<li>PostgresSQL files have been corrected. Note that while we ship postgres
files, it is not an officially supported database.</li>
<li>After nodes had been deleted, locks were not automatically removed. This was
problematic, because re-creating a node could cause it to be locked
instantly. This is now fixed.</li>
<li>There were some problems with both the default Cal- and CardDAV PDO
backends, when the 'Sync' plugin is not enabled. This is now resolved.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upgrade sabre/dav by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/dav

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/vobject 3.3.1.</p>

<p>Several bugs have been found in 3.3.0, all mostly related to the newly
introduced <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip</a> functionality.</p>

<p>This release also adds a new feature that allows people to specify new
DATE-TIME values by passing PHP <a href="http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php">DateTime</a> objects as such:</p>

<pre><code>$vevent-&gt;DTSTART = new DateTime('...');
</code></pre>

<p>This was already possible in a lot of other places, but somehow this was
missed for the 'magic property setter'.</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

<p>If this didn't upgrade you to 3.3.1, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "~3.3.1"
</code></pre>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/vobject 3.3.0!</p>

<p>This release has a few new features, but also changes a few things. For most
people the upgrade should be seamless though.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<h3>Better RRULE parser</h3>

<p>We now have much better support for <code>RRULE</code>, and especially exceptions to
recurrences. This solved several bugs that have been outstanding for quite
some time.</p>

<p>We now also support <code>RDATE</code>.</p>

<p>One change is that the old <code>Sabre\VObject\RecurrenceIterator</code> is now renamed
to <code>Sabre\VObject\Recur\EventIterator</code>. The old class still exists, but will
be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>Some more info about this feature <a href="/vobject/recurrence/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>iTip support</h3>

<p>VObject now supports generating and parsing <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip</a> messages. iTip messages
are a type of iCalendar object that are used for things like invites, replies
and cancellations.</p>

<p>More info about this feature on the <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip page</a>.</p>

<h3>Switched to PSR-4</h3>

<p>The directory structure of the VObject library changed. Everything that was
previously in <code>lib/Sabre/VObject</code> is now moved to <code>lib/</code>.</p>

<p>If you are using composer you don't have to change a thing, but if you
manually wrote an autoloader, you may have to make a change to accomodate for
this.</p>

<p>We also removed <code>lib/Sabre/VObject/includes.php</code>.</p>

<h3>Changelog</h3>

<p>Full changelog can be found on <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-vobject/blob/3.3.0/ChangeLog.md">Github</a></p>

<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<p>To update your sabre/vobject, edit composer.json to make sure that it includes
a line like this:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "~3.3.0"
</code></pre>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of right now, sabre/dav 1.7 has reached end of life status.</p>

<p>Version 1.8 has been released in November 2012, so people had 20 months to
upgrade their systems.</p>

<p>We've done one final release (1.7.13), containing a few minor fixes and a newer
version of the sabre/vobject library (if you're using the zip installation).</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/dav by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/dav
</code></pre>

<p>Or download the zip from the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/releases">releases</a> page.</p>

<p>Full changelog can be found on <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/blob/1.7.13/ChangeLog">Github</a></p>

<h3>What does this mean?</h3>

<p>From this point forward, we will no longer accept bug reports for version 1.7.</p>

<p>Also, no future releases will be made.</p>

<p>We <em>may</em> consider certain security bugs, but there are no guarantees.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to 1.8</h3>

<p>Upgrading to version 1.8 is not difficult. The main change that has been made
between these versions, is that 1.8 makes use of PHP namespaces, where 1.7
uses the classic 'pear-style' prefix notation.</p>

<p>Make sure to check out the <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/1.7-to-1.8/">migration instructions</a> for a detailed overview
of the changes.</p>

<p>Keep in mind though that version 2.0 of sabre/dav is also already released. If
you are upgrading, you're highly encouraged to take that additional upgrade
step. Version 2.0 has its own <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/1.8-to-2.0/">migration instructions</a>.</p>

<p>A number of problems were found in the revamped browser plugin, related to
generating links, and for a number of people none of the css and images
would load due to incorrect CSP rules.</p>

<p>In addition we found out that the <code>TooMuchMatches</code> exception never worked
due to a fatal error, so while fixing that, we also took the opportunity to
change the name of the exception to <code>TooManyMatches</code>. Don't laugh.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/event 2.0.0. This releases adds a few features, and
also slightly alters the API.</p>

<h3>New stuff</h3>

<ol>
<li>Support for <a href="/event/promise/">promises</a>.</li>
<li>The event handler is now faster. This is especially noticable when making a
lot of subscriptions to a single event, and is likely unnoticable for most.</li>
<li>Added support for something called the 'continue callback' to to the
EventEmitter. This makes it possible to implement something similar to
javascript's <code>preventDefault</code>.</li>
<li>When calling removeAllListeners without an argument, all listeners for all
events are removed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Api breaks</h3>

<ol>
<li>We switched to PSR-4 for autoloading.</li>
<li>EventEmitter::listeners() no longer returns a manipulatable array of event
listeners by reference. It's not a simple list of callbacks, sorted by
their priority. The original concept was good on paper.</li>
<li>The argument on <code>removeAllListeners</code> is now optional.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upgrade sabre/event by making sure your composer.json references <code>~2.0.0</code>, and
then run:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/event
</code></pre>
