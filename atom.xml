            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released version 1.0.0 of a new URI library. This library solves a
few common problems we've been having, or simply did not do well enough in
the past.</p>

<p>The library is super light-weight and just provides 5 functions. We hope
it's useful for other people aside from us, but we'll be adding this as a new
dependency to sabre/xml, sabre/http, sabre/dav and in the future sabre/vobject,
as they all do 'stuff' with URIs, and were not doing everything in the best
way possible.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="/uri/">documentation</a> if you'd like to learn more.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/dav version 2.1. This release comes about 6 months
after the last major release, so that's nicely on track!</p>

<h2>New features</h2>

<h3>Scheduling</h3>

<p>We finally have support for CalDAV Scheduling (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6638">rfc6638</a>). Adding
scheduling to your server means that you can invite attendees to your events,
and have those invites automatically delivered to other calendars on the
system.</p>

<p>CalDAV clients that support this will be able to show an invitation interface
and allow attendees to accept or decline invitations, and have all of this
processed on the server.</p>

<p>If you're inviting attendees that are not on the server, you can also
optionally set-up an iMip (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6047">rfc6047</a>) plugin. This will allow the
server to send invitation emails on behalf of the user.</p>

<p>For more information, read the <a href="/dav/scheduling/">scheduling</a> documentation.</p>

<h3>vCard 4 support</h3>

<p>In the past, the CardDAV plugin only supported vCard 3.0, which is the vCard
version that's required for CardDAV and also what most clients use.</p>

<p>Since sabre/dav 2.1, the server also support vCard 4.0 (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350">rfc6350</a>).
vCard 4.0 is a much more modern format, adds a lot of great features, and
doesn't suffer from many of the problems vCard 3.0 had.</p>

<p>Now if a client stores either a vCard 3 or 4, these vCards will be stored
as-is, but if a client requests either a vCard 3 or 4 (using
content-negotation), we will automatically convert the vcard before sending
it back to the client.</p>

<h3>jCard support</h3>

<p>It's now also possible for clients to request jCard (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7095">rfc7095</a>).
jCard is a JSON representation of vCard 4.0.</p>

<p>jCard is much easier to parse than vCard 4.0, so we also highly recommend
client developers to start supporting this.</p>

<h3>ChangeLog</h3>

<p>A lot of smaller changes have been made since version 2.0. You can find more
details in the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/blob/2.1.0/ChangeLog.md">ChangeLog</a>. Read from 2.1.0-alpha1 onwards, as most changes
have been made in the alpha versions.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>As always, the zip can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/releases">github releases page</a>, but the
recommended installation method is using composer:</p>

<pre><code>composer require sabre/dav ~2.1.0
</code></pre>

<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<p>A few backwards compatibility breaks have been made in this release. Overall
they should be pretty minor and easy to deal with.</p>

<p>If you are running a standard server, it's likely that you only have to run
the database upgrade script, but if you did any sort of customizations,
chances are that you need to make changes in your code to keep stuff running.</p>

<p><strong>Make a backup.</strong> and then head to the <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/2.0-to-2.1/">migration instructions</a> for 2.1.</p>

<p>Drop a line on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sabredav-discuss">mailing list</a> if you run into any issues, or
<a href="http://sabre.io/support/">get in touch with us</a> for our commercial support options.</p>

<h2>Support status</h2>

<p>Due to the 2.1 release, 2.0 now enters maintenance mode. This means that
version 2.0 of sabre/dav will be actively maintained for the next 12 months.</p>

<p>More information about previous versions and their support status can be found
on the <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/upgrading/">upgrade</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
