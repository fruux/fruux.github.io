<ul>
<li>We now require libxml 2.7.0 in composer. We always needed this as a minumum

enough space to make a calendar to be able to hold events, todos and
journals all at once.</li>
<li>Upgraded sabre/vobject, this will fix a number of scheduling-related bugs.</li>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/vobject 4.1.0. This release is fully compatible with
the 4.0.x series.</p>

<p>This release adds a <code>Sabre\VObject\PHPUnitAssertions</code> trait that, for now,
contains a <code>assertVObjectEqualsVObject()</code> function. This functions works
similar to PHPUnit's built-in <code>assertXmlStringEqualsXmlString()</code>, and can be
used by implementors to check if two iCalendar objects or vCards are identical
semantically.</p>

<p>It also contains a number of other fixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>When doing recurrence expansion, the first event now also have a
<code>RECURRENCE-ID</code> property.</li>
<li>Fixes a bug in processing iTip REPLYs to recurring events.</li>
<li>Better error messages and improved validation in a number of areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CalDAV/CardDAV sharing is something <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/pull/696">we've worked on</a> for quite some time.
Our goal is to have out of the box CalDAV sharing working in the next sabre/dav
version</p>

<p>It's taking a long time to implement, because we're not just writing the code,
we're also writing the standard.</p>

<p>These are the current drafts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-webdav-notifications">WebDAV notifications</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing">WebDAV resource sharing</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-caldav-sharing">CalDAV sharing</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today I wrote an article on my own blog about how it works and the current
status. <a href="https://evertpot.com/webdav-caldav-carddav-sharing/">Read it here</a>.</p>

<p>We'll be at CalConnect 36 in Hong Kong next month to discuss this more. If
you're in the area and want to discuss calendaring or sabre/dav, drop us a line!</p>

            <link href="http://sabre.io/blog/2016/baikal-0.4.0-release"/>
            <updated>2016-03-15T21:40:12+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://sabre.io/blog/2016/baikal-0.4.0-release</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released Baïkal 0.4.0. This release contains a number of changes that
should improve the system for a number of users. The 0.3.x range of releases
had seen a number of stability problems, due to a relatively big sabre/dav
upgrade.</p>

<p>I'm attributing the issues to growing pains. With the 0.4.0 release we hope
that the most of the common issues are solved. This release contains the
following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>SQlite users had issues syncing. This was due to a newly added feature
(sync reports). Upgrading to 0.4.0 will repair your database schema and
should make existing setups sync again.</li>
<li>The installation threw an error if you didn't have the Sqlite PDO PHP
extension installed.</li>
<li>We added the "Property storage" plugin. This enables a range of features
for clients, such as availability, default alarms and "me card".</li>
<li>We added the Scheduling plugin, which adds scheduling and free-busy.
Enabling this should also solve a problem with iCal, which behaved badly
without this plugin.</li>
<li>We removed the "admin locking" features. In the past it was possible to
disable the Baïkal admin by removing the <code>ENABLE_ADMIN</code> file from the
<code>Specific/</code> folder. This feature is now no longer supported, and users
should instead use their Webserver configuration to block access to
the admin.</li>
</ul>
