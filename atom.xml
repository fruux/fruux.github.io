            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of right now, sabre/dav 1.7 has reached end of life status.</p>

<p>Version 1.8 has been released in November 2012, so people had 20 months to
upgrade their systems.</p>

<p>We've done one final release (1.7.13), containing a few minor fixes and a newer
version of the sabre/vobject library (if you're using the zip installation).</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/dav by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/dav
</code></pre>

<p>Or download the zip from the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/releases">releases</a> page.</p>

<p>Full changelog can be found on <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/blob/1.7.13/ChangeLog.md">Github</a></p>

<h3>What does this mean?</h3>

<p>From this point forward, we will no longer accept bug reports for version 1.7.</p>

<p>Also, no future releases will be made.</p>

<p>We <em>may</em> consider certain security bugs, but there are no guarantees.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to 1.8</h3>

<p>Upgrading to version 1.8 is not difficult. The main change that has been made
between these versions, is that 1.8 makes use of PHP namespaces, where 1.7
uses the classic 'pear-style' prefix notation.</p>

<p>Make sure to check out the <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/1.7-to-1.8/">migration instructions</a> for a detailed overview
of the changes.</p>

<p>Keep in mind though that version 2.0 of sabre/dav is also already released. If
you are upgrading, you're highly encouraged to take that additional upgrade
step. Version 2.0 has its own <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/1.8-to-2.0/">migration instructions</a>.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/dav 2.0.3.</p>

<p>A number of problems were found in the revamped browser plugin, related to
generating links, and for a number of people none of the css and images
would load due to incorrect CSP rules.</p>

<p>In addition we found out that the <code>TooMuchMatches</code> exception never worked
due to a fatal error, so while fixing that, we also took the opportunity to
change the name of the exception to <code>TooManyMatches</code>. Don't laugh.</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/dav by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/dav

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/event 2.0.0. This releases adds a few features, and
also slightly alters the API.</p>

<h3>New stuff</h3>

<ol>
<li>Support for <a href="/event/promise/">promises</a>.</li>
<li>The event handler is now faster. This is especially noticable when making a
lot of subscriptions to a single event, and is likely unnoticable for most.</li>
<li>Added support for something called the 'continue callback' to to the
EventEmitter. This makes it possible to implement something similar to
javascript's <code>preventDefault</code>.</li>
<li>When calling removeAllListeners without an argument, all listeners for all
events are removed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Api breaks</h3>

<ol>
<li>We switched to PSR-4 for autoloading.</li>
<li>EventEmitter::listeners() no longer returns a manipulatable array of event
listeners by reference. It's not a simple list of callbacks, sorted by
their priority. The original concept was good on paper.</li>
<li>The argument on <code>removeAllListeners</code> is now optional.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upgrade sabre/event by making sure your composer.json references <code>~2.0.0</code>, and
then run:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/event
</code></pre>

            <link href="http://sabre.io/blog/2014/jcal-rfc"/>
            <updated>2014-06-02T20:55:42+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://sabre.io/blog/2014/jcal-rfc</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The IETF just made <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7265">jCal</a> available as <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7265">rfc7265</a></p>

<p>jCal is a format to encode <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545">iCalendar</a>, but instead of using the clumsy, and
old 'mimedir' format, it uses <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> to encode the data.</p>

<p>This is very similar to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7095">jCard</a>, which is the json-encoded version of
vCards.</p>

<p>We're big fans of this new format. It can already be parsed by <a href="/vobject/json/">vobject</a>
and if you're running sabre/dav 2.0, the server can already emit it from REPORT
and GET requests and accept it from PUT requests.</p>

<p>We recommend everyone in the industry to consider generating jCal where they
are generating iCalendar today. It's a lot easier to parse and generate, and
we hope that over time, jCal and jCard replace iCalendar and vCard as the
format of choice.</p>
