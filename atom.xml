            <updated>2016-01-11T18:39:49+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://sabre.io/blog/2016/sabre-vobject-3.4.9-and-3.5.0-release</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a reversal of an earlier statement, we're releasing a sabre/vobject 3.x
version with PHP 7 support.</p>

<p>We just release two new versions of the sabre/vobject package; <code>3.4.9</code> and
<code>3.5.0</code>.  <code>3.4.9</code> is identical to <code>3.4.8</code> but now explictly forbids being
installed on PHP 7, via composer.json.</p>

<p><code>3.5.0</code> introduces two differences:</p>

<ol>
<li>PHP 7 <em>is</em> supported.</li>
<li>Two classes have been renamed. <code>Sabre\VObject\Property\Float</code> is now
<code>Sabre\VObject\Property\FloatValue</code> and <code>Sabre\VObject\Property\Integer</code>
is now called <code>Sabre\VObject\Property\IntegerValue</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For most people the new class names will have 0 effect on your code. Almost
everyone should just be able to upgrade from 3.4.x to 3.5.0 without any
modifications.</p>

<p>The reason we've done this is due to some external pressure of sabre/* users,
who argued that it's not good that there's not a single sabre/vobject or sabre/dav
package that supports <em>both</em> PHP 5.4 and PHP 7. Thankfully this change is small
enough that it's relatively low impact.</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

<p>If this didn't upgrade you to 3.5.0, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "^3.5.0"
</code></pre>

<p>Because the difference is so minor, in the future we'll only maintain the 3.5
(and 4.0) branch of vobject, and effectively drop support for 3.4. If this
concerns you, drop me a line as maybe we can help.</p>

<p>The <code>3.4.9</code> tag therefore mainly exist as an indicator to people who have a
composer dependency targetting <code>3.4.*</code> with composer and are attempting to
use PHP7, or people who have a rather complex dependency tree.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just released sabre/vobject 4.0.2.</p>

<p>This version fixes a regression introduced in 4.0.0. When parsing objects with
a <code>CHARSET</code> parameter, in documents that do not support <code>CHARSET</code>, which is
everything except vCard 2.1, the parser would throw an error for unrecognized
values.</p>

<p>If you are parsing iCalendar or vCards, upgrading is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

<p>If this didn't upgrade you to 4.0.2, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "~4.0.2"
</code></pre>

            <updated>2016-01-06T23:34:20+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://sabre.io/blog/2016/sabre-dav-3.1-release</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're a bit late to the party, but we finally have a PHP 7 compatible release
for sabre/dav.</p>

<p>The master branch had PHP 7 support for a while. The original plan for 3.1 was
to include CalDAV sharing support, but this has been taking longer than
expected.</p>

<p>The result was that we have not had a stable PHP 7-compatible release. So
instead of waiting until all the 3.1 features were ready, we've figured it's
better to get 3.1 out as soon as possible and move the new features over to
a future 3.2 release. So here it is, 6 months after the last major release!</p>

<p>Aside from PHP 7 support, there's a few other changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The minimum PHP version is now PHP 5.5.</li>
<li>We switched to <a href="/blog/2015/sabre-vobject-4.0-released/">vobject 4</a></li>
<li>We have support for "Calendar availability" in CalDAV. This feature allows
users to specify what their work hours are (using compatible clients). This
information will then be taken into consideration when generating freebusy
responses.</li>
<li>Lots of memory improvements, stability fixes and better exception messaging.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contrary to past 'major' releases, this should be fairly easy for people to
upgrade to. The BC changes will only affect a very small group.</p>

<ul>
<li>For a full list of changes and BC breaks, read <a href="/dav/upgrade/3.0-to-3.1/">the migration document</a>.</li>
<li>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/blob/3.1.0/CHANGELOG.md">Changelog</a> if you need even more detail.</li>
<li>Use composer, or <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/releases">download the zip</a> to get started with this.</li>
</ul>

<p>This release also marks the beginning of the 'life support' period for
sabre/dav 3.0.x. We'll continue to do bugfixes for another 12 months.</p>

<p>Happy new year!</p>
