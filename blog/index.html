    <p>We just released sabre/vobject 3.3.3.</p>

<p>This release has additional fixes and improvements for the <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip</a>
subsystem.</p>

<p>This release also works around a PHP bug that would otherwise spam your php
error log file with 'invalid timezone' exceptions and has support for the
"Line Islands Standard Time" timezone coming from Microsoft products.</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

<p>If this didn't upgrade you to 3.3.3, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "~3.3.3"
</code></pre>

    <h1><a href="http://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabre-http-3.0.0-release">sabre/http 3.0.0 release</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/http 3.0.0.</p>

<p>We introduced several API breaking changes, so a major version change was
warranted.</p>

<p>In particular, we modified the API to be closer to the draft version of
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md">psr/http</a>.</p>

<p>psr/http is an upcoming standard for PHP development that should unify how we
represent HTTP requests and responses in PHP.</p>

<p>There were several good ideas in this spec, in particular how HTTP headers
are treated, especially when there are multiple headers with the same name,
which is something sabre/http dealt poorly with (not at all).</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Switched to a PSR-4 directory structure in <code>lib/</code>. This means all classes
are now in <code>lib/</code> instead of <code>lib/Sabre/HTTP</code>. This should not change a
thing if you use the composer autoloader.</li>
<li><code>::setHeaders()</code> used to delete all previous http headers. This is no longer
the case, new headers will simply be added to the existing ones.</li>
<li>Added <code>::getHeaderAsArray()</code>. This method returns a single http header. If
multiple headers with the same name were specified, each value will be an
item in this array.</li>
<li>If you use <code>::getHeader()</code>, and there were more than 1 http header with that
name, we now concatenate all these headers with a comma (<code>,</code>).</li>
<li><code>::addHeader()</code> is new, and will preserve any existing header with that
name. Instead, a second header will be added with the same name and a new
value.</li>
<li><code>::getHeaders()</code> will now return each header value as an array.</li>
<li>The <code>Client</code> class now only follows redirects to HTTP and HTTPS urls.</li>
<li><code>Util::negotiate</code> is deprecated, use <code>Util::negotiateContentType</code> instead.</li>
<li>The <code>Client</code> class can now follow redirects, even if the <code>open_basedir</code>
setting is turned on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<p>If you are using sabre/http solely through sabredav, don't upgrade yet unless
you are using the latest development version. If you use sabre/http
independently, ensure that the relevant line in your composer.json looks like
this:</p>

<pre><code>"require" : {
    "sabre/http" : "~3.0.0"
}
</code></pre>

<p>And run <code>composer update sabre/http</code> afterwards.</p>

<h2>No full psr/http compliance</h2>

<p>I've matched the Request and Response to behave closer to the draft psr-http
draft, <em>but</em> I didn't go all the way!</p>

<p>I strongly disapprove of how message bodies are represented. The PSR
introduces an object to wrap PHP streams, that has severely less features,
and due to its design it's incompatible with regular PHP streams and doesn't
cover all our use cases. All under the pretense that PHP streams are hard to
use.</p>

<p>Unless that's fixed, we'll not be fully supporting the specification, but it's
still a draft, and there's still time.</p>

<p>Further in-depth testing of the <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip</a> subsystem has revealed a <em>lot</em> of
small edge-cases that weren't properly covered.</p>

<p>In addition, we now correctly decode <code>ATTACH</code> properties in iCalendar objects

<p>This releases has a number of improvements, namely:</p>

<ol>
<li>PostgresSQL files have been corrected. Note that while we ship postgres
files, it is not an officially supported database.</li>
<li>After nodes had been deleted, locks were not automatically removed. This was
problematic, because re-creating a node could cause it to be locked
instantly. This is now fixed.</li>
<li>There were some problems with both the default Cal- and CardDAV PDO
backends, when the 'Sync' plugin is not enabled. This is now resolved.</li>

<p>Several bugs have been found in 3.3.0, all mostly related to the newly
introduced <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip</a> functionality.</p>

<p>This release also adds a new feature that allows people to specify new

<pre><code>$vevent-&gt;DTSTART = new DateTime('...');

    <p>We just released sabre/vobject 3.3.0!</p>

<p>This release has a few new features, but also changes a few things. For most
people the upgrade should be seamless though.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<h3>Better RRULE parser</h3>

<p>We now have much better support for <code>RRULE</code>, and especially exceptions to
recurrences. This solved several bugs that have been outstanding for quite
some time.</p>

<p>We now also support <code>RDATE</code>.</p>

<p>One change is that the old <code>Sabre\VObject\RecurrenceIterator</code> is now renamed
to <code>Sabre\VObject\Recur\EventIterator</code>. The old class still exists, but will
be removed in a future version.</p>

<p>Some more info about this feature <a href="/vobject/recurrence/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>iTip support</h3>

<p>VObject now supports generating and parsing <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip</a> messages. iTip messages
are a type of iCalendar object that are used for things like invites, replies
and cancellations.</p>

<p>More info about this feature on the <a href="/vobject/itip/">iTip page</a>.</p>

<h3>Switched to PSR-4</h3>

<p>The directory structure of the VObject library changed. Everything that was
previously in <code>lib/Sabre/VObject</code> is now moved to <code>lib/</code>.</p>

<p>If you are using composer you don't have to change a thing, but if you
manually wrote an autoloader, you may have to make a change to accomodate for
this.</p>

<p>We also removed <code>lib/Sabre/VObject/includes.php</code>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabre-dav-1.7-eol">sabre/dav 1.7 end of support</a></h1>
    <p>As of right now, sabre/dav 1.7 has reached end of life status.</p>

<p>Version 1.8 has been released in November 2012, so people had 20 months to
upgrade their systems.</p>

<p>We've done one final release (1.7.13), containing a few minor fixes and a newer
version of the sabre/vobject library (if you're using the zip installation).</p>

<p>Upgrade sabre/dav by running:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/dav
</code></pre>

<p>Or download the zip from the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/releases">releases</a> page.</p>

<p>Full changelog can be found on <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/blob/1.7.13/ChangeLog">Github</a></p>

<h3>What does this mean?</h3>

<p>From this point forward, we will no longer accept bug reports for version 1.7.</p>

<p>Also, no future releases will be made.</p>

<p>We <em>may</em> consider certain security bugs, but there are no guarantees.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to 1.8</h3>

<p>Upgrading to version 1.8 is not difficult. The main change that has been made
between these versions, is that 1.8 makes use of PHP namespaces, where 1.7
uses the classic 'pear-style' prefix notation.</p>

<p>Make sure to check out the <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/1.7-to-1.8/">migration instructions</a> for a detailed overview
of the changes.</p>

<p>Keep in mind though that version 2.0 of sabre/dav is also already released. If
you are upgrading, you're highly encouraged to take that additional upgrade
step. Version 2.0 has its own <a href="http://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/1.8-to-2.0/">migration instructions</a>.</p>

<p>A number of problems were found in the revamped browser plugin, related to
generating links, and for a number of people none of the css and images
would load due to incorrect CSP rules.</p>

<p>In addition we found out that the <code>TooMuchMatches</code> exception never worked
due to a fatal error, so while fixing that, we also took the opportunity to
change the name of the exception to <code>TooManyMatches</code>. Don't laugh.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabre-event-2.0">sabre/event 2.0 release</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/event 2.0.0. This releases adds a few features, and
also slightly alters the API.</p>

<h3>New stuff</h3>

<ol>
<li>Support for <a href="/event/promise/">promises</a>.</li>
<li>The event handler is now faster. This is especially noticable when making a
lot of subscriptions to a single event, and is likely unnoticable for most.</li>
<li>Added support for something called the 'continue callback' to to the
EventEmitter. This makes it possible to implement something similar to
javascript's <code>preventDefault</code>.</li>
<li>When calling removeAllListeners without an argument, all listeners for all
events are removed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Api breaks</h3>

<ol>
<li>We switched to PSR-4 for autoloading.</li>
<li>EventEmitter::listeners() no longer returns a manipulatable array of event
listeners by reference. It's not a simple list of callbacks, sorted by
their priority. The original concept was good on paper.</li>
<li>The argument on <code>removeAllListeners</code> is now optional.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upgrade sabre/event by making sure your composer.json references <code>~2.0.0</code>, and
then run:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/event
</code></pre>

    <h1><a href="http://sabre.io/blog/2014/jcal-rfc">jCal released as rfc7265</a></h1>
    <p>The IETF just made <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7265">jCal</a> available as <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7265">rfc7265</a></p>

<p>jCal is a format to encode <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545">iCalendar</a>, but instead of using the clumsy, and
old 'mimedir' format, it uses <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> to encode the data.</p>

<p>This is very similar to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7095">jCard</a>, which is the json-encoded version of
vCards.</p>

<p>We're big fans of this new format. It can already be parsed by <a href="/vobject/json/">vobject</a>
and if you're running sabre/dav 2.0, the server can already emit it from REPORT
and GET requests and accept it from PUT requests.</p>

<p>We recommend everyone in the industry to consider generating jCal where they
are generating iCalendar today. It's a lot easier to parse and generate, and
we hope that over time, jCal and jCard replace iCalendar and vCard as the
format of choice.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabredav-2-release">sabre/dav 2.0 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/dav 2.0. The last major release (1.8) was in <a href="http://evertpot.com/sabredav-18-released-with-namespaces/">2012</a>,
so it's been a long time coming.</p>

<h2>New features</h2>

<h3>New browser</h3>

<p><a href="/img/posts/new-browser.png" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
    <img src="/img/posts/new-browser.png" alt="new browser!" class="zoomAbleImage" width="300px" style="box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px #000"/>
</a></p>

<p>The browser got a big overhaul. It hadn't changed much since when it was
introduced in 2009, so a visual refresh was long due.</p>

<p>The new browser plugin shows you a lot more information about webdav
properties as well, making it a more useful debugging tool.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>A lot of focus has gone into performance, specifically in relation to Cal- and
CardDAV. We've been running the bleeding edge sabredav, and we've seen several
major cpu drops as we've kept sabredav up to date.</p>

<p>We've optimized queries, and provided new shortcuts in the system that allowed
backends to do optimizations that were not possible before.</p>

<p>Lastly, we added WebDAV-Sync support.</p>

<h3>WebDAV-Sync</h3>

<p>Support for WebDAV-Sync (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6578">rfc6578</a>) has been added. WebDAV-Sync is used by
an increasing number of popular Cal- and CardDAV clients. It allows clients to
request a list of changes that happened in calendar and/or addressbooks. This
can greatly reduce memory, bandwidth and cpu usage on both client and server,
and is well worth it.</p>

<p>It's available as a plugin and the appropriate interfaces have been added to
add support for WebDAV-Sync to the collections where you want to support it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, both the default Cal- and CardDAV PDO backends have out of the
box support.</p>

<h3>New packages</h3>

<p>This is the first sabredav release that ships with <a href="/vobject">sabre/vobject</a> 3.0, and
is also the first release that has part of it's functionality split out into
two new packages: <a href="/event">sabre/event</a> and <a href="/http">sabre/http</a>.</p>

<h3>Calendar subscription syncing</h3>

<p>There's a proprietary protocol that allows calendar clients to sync
subscriptions with a server. Support for this has been added to the CalDAV
plugin, and is also available in the default PDO backend.</p>

<p>This protocol is at least supported by <a href="http://www.busymac.com/busycal/">BusyCal</a> and Apple's iOS and OS X
clients.</p>

<h3>jCal support</h3>

<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jcardcal-jcal-10">jCal</a> is an upcoming standard for representing iCalendar objects in json.
sabre/dav now live converts back and forward between iCalendar and jCal, and
can return jCal everywhere it returns iCalendar.</p>

<p>We highly recommend using jCal over iCalendar. It's a much better format,
easier to parse, and likely to use less memory and cpu while parsing.</p>

<h3>New property system</h3>

<p>A big part of DAV protocols is related to storing and retrieving properties
on resources such as files and calendars.</p>

<p>The property system got a complete overhaul for this release. This allowed
for a great reduction in property-related code and allows for a new feature:
<a href="/dav/properties">storage of arbitrary properties</a>.</p>

<h3>PHP 5.4</h3>

<p>The minimum php version of sabre/dav has been increased to PHP 5.4. This was
needed for a number of reasons, such as better closure support and traits.</p>

<h3>And...</h3>

<p>The list of changes is rather massive. Read up on them in the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/blob/master/ChangeLog.md">ChangeLog</a>
from <code>1.9.0alpha1</code> onwards.</p>

<p>Also, this includes all the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-vobject/blob/master/ChangeLog.md">changes from sabre/vobject</a> from 3.0.0 onwards,
<a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-http/blob/master/ChangeLog">changes from sabre/http</a> from 2.0.0 onwards and everything from
sabre/event.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>As always, the zip can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/releases/">github releases page</a>, but the
recommended installation method is using composer:</p>

<pre><code>composer install sabre/dav ~2.0.0
</code></pre>

<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<p>A lot of things have changed in this release. If you are running a standard
server, it's likely that you only have to run the database upgrade script,
but if you did any sort of customizations, chances are that you need to make
changes in your code to keep stuff running.</p>

<p><strong>Make a backup.</strong> and then head to the <a href="/dav/upgrade/1.8-to-2.0/">migration instructions</a> for 2.0.</p>

<p>Drop a line on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sabredav-discuss">mailing list</a> if you run into any issues at all.</p>

<h2>Support status</h2>

<p>As of right now version <strong>1.7</strong> is no longer supported. <strong>1.8</strong> will be
supported for an entire year, until May 2015.</p>

<h2>Thank you</h2>

<p>This was literally the largest release we've ever done, seeing the biggest
diff, most new features, most contributors and longest development time.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for hanging in there and all your contributions.</p>

<p>I want to specifically thank <a href="https://github.com/staabm">Markus Staab</a> for tirelessly reviewing every
incoming commit, and <a href="https://twitter.com/DominikTo">Dominik Tobschall</a> for all the moral support.</p>

<p>Evert.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://sabre.io/blog/2014/sabredav-1.8.10">sabre/dav 1.7.12 and 1.8.10 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/dav 1.7.12 and 1.8.10. These two releases are mainly
bugfix releases centering around two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better support for If-Match and If-None-Match</li>
<li>Lots of updates in the <a href="/dav/http-patch">PATCH method</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Patch problems</h2>

<p>We've gotten reports that there were problems with the PATCH plugin, and
the <a href="/dav/http-patch">associated documentation</a>. Things were inconsistent and plain
incorrect at times.</p>

<p>We've extended the documentation a great deal, now allowing you to correctly
use negative offsets for patching and also appending.</p>

<p>We've also added a new interface to enable this functionality, namely
<code>Sabre\DAV\PartialUpdate\IPatchSupport</code>.</p>

<p>The existing interface <code>Sabre\DAV\PartialUpdate\IFile</code> is now deprecated and
will be removed in a future major version of sabre/dav. This was unfortunately
needed to fix what was considered a bit of a mess.</p>

<h2>VObject</h2>

<p>sabre/vobject in the zip package is now upgraded to 2.1.4, which works around
a backwards compatibile break that was introduced in PHP 5.5.10 in relation to
timezones.</p>

<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<p>To upgrade with composer, just run <code>composer update sabre/dav</code> on the command-
line.</p>

<p>The zip files can be found on <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/releases">github</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://sabre.io/blog/2014/vobject-3.2">sabre/vobject 3.2 released</a></h1>
    <p>We just released sabre/vobject 3.2.0. This release is backwards compatible
with the 3.1.* series.</p>

<p>New features:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are now fully <a href="http://hhvm.com/">hhvm</a> compatible. If you're running a recent hhvm
version, everything should work as expected. From this point forward, we
will also actively support hhvm.</li>
<li>The validator now understands a lot more validation rules. So using it now,
either with the API, or on the command-line, should yield a lot more
information.</li>
<li>Support for a range of new timezone identifiers.</li>
<li>Support for additional vcard properties from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6715">rfc6715</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6474.">rfc6474</a>.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a> utility, for easily generating unique strings for use in
<code>UID</code> properties.</li>
<li>Support for <code>BYMONTH</code> on <code>DAILY</code> recurrences.</li>
<li>Automatically fix broken vcards from Google's CardDAV server.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you like it! To upgrade with composer, make sure that your
<code>composer.json</code> has a line that says:</p>

<pre><code>"sabre/vobject" : "~3.2"
</code></pre>

<p>And then run:</p>

<pre><code>composer update sabre/vobject
</code></pre>

    <h1><a href="http://sabre.io/blog/2014/new-website">New website launched!</a></h1>
    <p>You're looking at the brand-new website for sabre/dav. Up until now sabre/dav
never had a proper website, and we've always just hosted from Google Code.</p>

<p>As Google slowly started to lose interested in code hosting, we migrated more
and more features to GitHub. The biggest thing left: the wiki. So what once
started as a place to host the new wiki, turned into a brand-new design, by
<a href="https://fruux.com/">our</a> very own Martin Kaniut, who's also responsible for the <a href="https://fruux.com/">fruux</a>
design.</p>

<p>We hope you like it, but since it's such a step up from Google Code, we're
confident you probably will ;). If you're running into any bugs, definitely
<a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre.io/issues">let us know</a>. Want to contribute to the wiki? The entire site is open source, so
<a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre.io/tree/master/source">take a look</a> at some of the existing pages and get cracking!</p>
