<p>There are a number problems that can cause empty files to appear on the server.
Because there are a number of different scenarios that can result in 0 byte
files, it's good to try to figure out which specific issue is the one you're
dealing with.</p>

<h2>Webserver and chunked transfer encoding</h2>

<p>There are a number of clients, in particular <a href="/dav/clients/finder">OS X's Finder</a>
and <a href="/dav/clients/transmit">Transmit</a> that use the so-called 'chunked tranfer'
encoding to create new files.</p>

<p>There are many webservers that do not support this. We recommend to use Apache
with mod_php (not fastcgi) and <strong>a recent version</strong> of nginx. Avoid Lighttpd.</p>

<p>When servers don't properly support chunked transfer encoding, the end result
seems to consistently be that either:</p>

<p>A <code>411 Length Required</code> error is returned, or the server completely discards
the request body (from <code>PUT</code>) and effectively tells PHP and SabreDAV that an
empty file was submitted.</p>

<p>See <a href="/dav/webservers">Webservers</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Clients submitting files in two phases</h2>

<p>There are a lot of WebDAV clients out there that create new files in two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>PUT an empty file</li>
<li>PUT again, but this time overwrite the original with the actual file data.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a result, it may simply seem that there is an empty, broken <code>PUT</code> coming
in, when the real one still has to arrive.</p>

<p>This can be a bit problematic for people who write custom storage mechanisms
for SabreDAV (<a href="/dav/virtual-filesystems">Virtual filesystems</a>). So keep in
mind that as you're writing custom nodes, and you want to support standard
WebDAV clients, receiving an empty 0-byte file first is expected.</p>

<h2>Locking</h2>

<p>Furthermore, there are clients that support <code>LOCK</code>. Clients may <code>LOCK</code> a url
before creating a new file. The idea is that while the file is locked, some
other client cannot start creating a file with the same name.</p>

<p>How <code>LOCK</code> should behave on a non-existant url is a bit confusing, because the
initial webdav standard (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2518">rfc2518</a>) differs from the updated standard
(<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918">rfc4918</a>). SabreDAV follows the recomendation from the latest
specification.</p>

<p>That is: If a client makes a <code>LOCK</code> request on a url that <em>does not yet</em>
exist, SabreDAV itself will create an empty file at that location.</p>

<p>So this is another situation where an empty file may be created before the
<em>actual</em> file comes in.</p>

<h2>What if the is no follow-up PUT?</h2>

<p>If files stay empty, and there is no <code>PUT</code> request after the initial <code>LOCK</code>
or preflight <code>PUT</code>, the only explanation that can be given is, "there's a bug
somewhere".</p>

<p>It is possible that this bug is in your WebDAV client, it's also possible that
it's in SabreDAV.</p>

<p>The best recommendation we have is to fire up <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a> and start
inspecting the traffic. You may simply come across a PHP error in charles that
explains everything. Note that the problem may not be in the actual <code>PUT</code>
request, but it could also be in surrounding requests such as <code>PROPFIND</code></p>

<p>After that, we would just suggest to head to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sabredav-discuss">mailing list</a> so we can
investigate. 9 times out of 10 this tends to be a configuration mistake or a
bug somewhere in custom written code.</p>

<p>We will <em>almost always</em> need a charles capture or a publically accessible
server though. Have this prepared to get to a solution quicker.</p>
